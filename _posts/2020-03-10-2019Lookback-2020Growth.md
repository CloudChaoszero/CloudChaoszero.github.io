It's been a while since I've produced some quality personal content. Moreover, I've noticed that it's been 1 year since my time as a Data Analyst at Autodesk! 

It's been an amazing journey to work in a start-up lifestyle meanwhile working at a coorperate level (e.g. working with other Company Acquisition teams with reporting and consolidating data infrastructure).

Anyways, I thought it would be beneficial to provide some lessons learned, and where I am thinking about focusing in for 2020.


# 1. Lessons Learned

Every year I grow. Alternatively, every year I make mistakes, improve on them, and continue to drive impact in the respective tasks.

Here are a few critical lessons learned, that I hope the reader can take

## 1.1. Having a healthy "Success" Mindset

In academia, I was always trying to better myself to be better than myself, or mainly my peers. And when I would not do well, I always took those thoughts with such shame, and never something as a grain of salt.

Even when I started in my own career path, I still was ashamed of lack of enthusiasm in deliverables, lack of productionizing some analyses, and so much more. Thinking in the day, even weeks, I would sometimes wonder why (And slightyly cringe).

However, learning from [Lex Fridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman), 
"Success is finding and paving your own path. It's not defined by someone else's success" regardless of current state."

This also goes in hand with the next topic...

Humility

## 1.3. Degrees don't imply a Top Contending Worker

> You may know more, but you can still feel like you know less

## 1.4. I Have Spare Time

In 2010, I gave up my most valued hobby--video games. I thought I was doing well. However, as a substitute, I was still binging on Youtube, movies, and shows. Now, this is the norm from such subscription services like Netflix & Hulu. However, I realized in 2016 and forward that I needed to do more.

I still watch content, but I now do try to create barriers to carve out more time in my day to personal development, outside of my existing work. Moreover, in the past month I noticed I have not ran--and used time as an excuse.

**However**, there can be room for improvement. I've used Androids Focus Mode functionality and Calendar planning for a move effective scheduling to focus on priorities on career. Moreover, I had the chance to start Commute by either Running or riding a bike through some planning. Feel free to ask how that's going. :D

## 1.5. Do I really Care about Diversity?

## 1.6. Re-using my Saw Dust in my Carpentry of work

I have to give some credit to this Youtube on shedding some light
