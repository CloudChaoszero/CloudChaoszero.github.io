20'twent--what is that? Just kidding. 

2020 was truly a, yes, 'unprecedented' and troubling time for us all, in varying degree. I've been truly blessed with what I have now with my relative privelege, compared to my (stereotypically) expected lifestyle. 

What do I mean by that?

## Self-Reflection

In the past decade, I had the opportunity to endure a path of achieving my personal 5-year goals both in 2010 & 2016, graduating from college & getting a career, respectively. However, this was never expected from me.


In 2009'ish, I had the opportunity to drop out of High School, without particular reprocussions. In 2010, the Great Recession lead me to not finding a job. Therefore, I enrolled into Junior College, not knowing what to do. In 2016, I had the opportunity to save up ~2months worth of rent and take a risk to move to San Francisco, or move back to Modesto.

I had several opportunities to regress back into my expected state of life, even so without a safety net. However, keeping that in mind, with lot of preparation, grit, network of opportunities & people, someone to personally help me in my journey, I am fortunately still able to continue with my goals without minimized 2020 setback. 

This is not a boast, flex, or pride in my relative privelege. But rather, a re-focus on what impact have I made in these past few years for different lower-income communities, meanwhile my pursuit of my ambitions.

Visibily experiencing the k-shaped bifurcation of the economy, theme of rich keep on getting richer, and contuing with my ambitiions with lesser degree of impact from 'The 'Rona', I have somewhat continued to drift, meanwhile knowing there are others like me that are dealing with their own hardships.

Keeping that in mind, I lay out my Roadmap for the next 5 years.



## Ethics & Altruisim



### Contribute your time, not your skills

Volunteering with Nonprofits in operational related capacities, yes I was able to assist them. However, have I truly helped out the communities I wanted to help? Was my impact truly, 'impactful'?

Sometimes, I felt that wasn't the case--and maybe it was because I haven't  had by 'boots to the ground'.


However, I will try to mind contributing my skills in the Data-related space. Moreover, if there are any helpful tips I can provide to individuals, I am happy to 'Share the Codes'.

### Minimizing predatory mis/dis information to Americans


I've been fortunate to started my journey online in 2009, as it was growing into what it is now, from the Facebook era.

However, though I grew with the ecosystem, there are others that jumped into it, not knowing how to navigate certain groups (echo chambers), and I think it's because there is no proper training/onboarding for these groups to navigate the internet, similar to my skilsets.

For example, the origins of Q-anon conspiracy group are from 4-chan, and then 8 chan. If you knew about them in the past, you surely know you don't go on 4 & 8 chan **with your life**. 

However, there are those that strayed into those landscapes, and adopted such ideas--this group in particular happened to be conserviates, due to the nature of the Social Dilemma.

## Career

### Data Science -- Expodited Growth

In 2016, I graduated with a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics and Minor in Economics. But surprisingly, I didn't know what I wanted to do. Summarized in the next referenced link, I aspired to go into Data Science with really starting [the initiative in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGBGetoOW4s&pbjreload=101). In that, I had the opportunity to feature my ["5-Year Plan For Career Success" in a Udacity blog post](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/12/5-year-plan-for-career-success.html) by Caroline Watson.

### Transparent Background


* Linkedin
  * I'll be more transparent about my background both on Linkedin and my curated [Job Search Preparation material](https://raulingaverage.dev/job-search) for lower-income individuals who are interested in starting their career.




Now, I end with a sentimental song I heard as a Modesto, CA kid.
