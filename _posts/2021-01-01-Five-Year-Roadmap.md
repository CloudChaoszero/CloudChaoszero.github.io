20'twent--what is that?

2020 was truly, yes I will repeat it, an 'unprecedented' and troubling time for us all. However, there are those who quite haven't been impacted by the COVID-19 situation, and I feel I've been truly blessed to be somewhat in that cohort, given my relative privelege.

What do I mean by that?

## Self-Reflection

In the past decade, I had the opportunity to endure and succeed in my path & objectives. In that path were underlying 2010 & 2016 5-year goals, graduating from college & getting a career, respectively. However, these ambitions and goals were certainly never expected of me. How so?

* ~2009: I had the opportunity to drop out of High School, without traditional 'sit-com family confrentational' reprocussions I used to watch.

* 2010: The Great Recession lead me to not finding a job. Therefore, I enrolled into Junior College, not knowing what to do.

* ~2016: I had the opportunity to save up ~2months worth of rent and take a risk to move to San Francisco, or move back to Modesto.

I had several opportunities to regress into an expected lifestyle, even so without a safety net. However, keeping that in mind, with lot of preparation, grit, network of opportunities & people, someone to personally help me in my journey, I am fortunately still able to continue with my goals without minimized 2020 setback--hence, having a relative privilege.

This prelude is not a boast, flex, or brag. But rather, a reflection on some thoughts I had in the past couple of years, especially this one...
* Have given back to lower-income communities, whilst pursuing my ambitions. 
* Am I another case of cruising upwards into middle-class, while ignoring my origins?

Visibily experiencing the [k-shaped](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/americas-v-shaped-vs-k-shaped-economic-recovery-what-does-it-all-mean/) bifurcation of the economy, theme of rich keep on getting richer, and contuing with my ambitiions with lesser degree of impact from 'The 'Rona', I have somewhat continued to drift, meanwhile knowing there are others like me that are dealing with their own hardships.

Keeping that in mind, I lay out my Roadmap for the next 5 years.

## 1. Altruism

From the Black Lives Matter Movement, deaths of icons like [Kobe Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant), [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg), [John Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis), and more, I reflect on the numbing pain of the overarching success they've achieved in their own lives, and relate how I can be a contributing factor to maintain or continue on their initiatives.

### 1.1 Contribute your time, not your skills

I am currently, and have, volunteered with Nonprofits these past few years. The responsibilities associated with these contributions have been in Operational & Strategty-capacities. However, was my perceived impact...truly 'impactful'?

If true, this insignificant impact to individuals This can be consequential in that have I given more than I've taken from the San Francisco community that I have been a part of? Moreover, how can I represent the good of tech workers (ignoring the acclaimed Excodus that is happening in 2020).

Sometimes, I felt that wasn't the case--and maybe it was because I haven't had by 'boots to the ground'.

That being said, to give more than I've taken away from the San Francisco community, I need to contribute more time than my skills. Moreover, how can I lead by example both in the subcommunities that I interact with?

### 1.2 Share The Codes

This section can be summarized in the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHARETHECODES?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SHARETHECODES</a> üí´üå± <a href="https://twitter.com/Pharrell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pharrell</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tylerthecreator</a> <a href="https://t.co/nJm5WnzGbG">pic.twitter.com/nJm5WnzGbG</a></p>&mdash; my.üíÖüèΩ (@_MAYA_A_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MAYA_A_/status/1331667687815086080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### 1.3 Minimizing predatory mis/dis information to Americans


I've been fortunate to started my journey online in 2009, when I bought my own HP laptop. Starting their, I had the opportunity to grow and contribute to the internet culture with early adoption of [Rage Comic memes](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/memes-that-defined-the-2010s), [Golden Age of Youtube](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators), and more.

However, many other cohorts have jumped into it without proper introduction, onboarding, or guidance on how to navigate the internet.

(E.g. [The Social deilemma](https://g.co/kgs/LZikMX), tying truth with memes, [Q-Anon](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/men-qanon/story?id=73046374), echo chambers, etc).

Moreover, even with younger demographics or even my age group, I would assumed aligned moral ethics and upholdment of truth would reside in their hearts. However, they've become one-issue partisan where if their issue is not addressed, then no matter their morals, they'll stick with the unjust. Even to older demographics, how can I educate them on how to properly navigate the internet, meanwhile not impose too much bias into those recommendations?

**This is something I am still thinking about how to solve**. If you have a suitable solution in the meantime, feel free to let me know.

## 2.0 Career

### 2.1 Data Science -- Exponential Growth?

In 2016, I graduated with a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics and Minor in Economics. But surprisingly, I didn't know what I wanted to do. [From that time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGBGetoOW4s&pbjreload=101), I aspired to go into Data Science, which can be summarized in the opportunity to be featured in a Udacity blog  ["5-Year Plan For Career Success" in a Udacity blog post](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/12/5-year-plan-for-career-success.html) by Caroline Watson.

This year, I have never been in a position to take my next steps into Data Science. With that being said, I plan to do the following:
* Officially have a Data Science title and responsibilties
* Contribute to Open Source
  * Give back more than I've taken from the Python community (i.e. not being part of the stadium group, mentioned by [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source by Nadia Eghbal](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862))
* Continue with Data-related Nonprofit contributions

### 2.2 Transparent Background


* Linkedin
  * I'll be more transparent about my background both on Linkedin and my curated [Job Search Preparation material](https://raulingaverage.dev/job-search) for lower-income individuals who are interested in starting their career.

* Offer more transparent background in workshop/talks

### 3.0 Personal

* Celebrating my 10 year anniversary of running a Marathon.

* Losing weight, per usual :cry:

* Frequently travel to the London

* Travel to five Countries, that I have not already been to.

* Attend [Defcon Festival by Q-dance in Europe](https://youtu.be/vJ2eHsQv7Ac?t=3779)

* Home Ownership?

## Wrapping it all up

Looking back into past decade, I've updated my goals to center around more Altruistic contributions, meanwhile pursuiing my career path & personal goals.

Now, I end with this Roadmap with two sentimental songs I heard as a kid.
