# Where have I been?

2022, the sun is coming up, climate change is becoming more real, and I've never been more excited at some new challenges and joy in my life. I've been gone sometime! I had a combination of technical issues updating this blog, personal life updates, and work life udpates that prevented me from updating y'all.

They are:
1. I started becoming a YIMBY and Bike/Transit Advocate in California
2. I became a Senior Data Analyst at my current company
3. I couldn't update this blog due to code-dependency issues


## 1. YIMBY and Bike/Transit Advocate.

You can find how I get started into advocacy, [here.](https://raulingaverage.dev/notes/yimby)

### TL;DR

> I advocate for diverse dense housing and tenant protections to ensure low-income people like my past self donâ€™t get displaced, rent is stable, and more.

> Ultimately, I would like to reduce poverty, end homelessness, eliminate racial segregation, create jobs, mitigate displacement, and slow climate change.

## 2. Senior Data Analyst

I'm happy to announce I am a Senior Data Analyst at Autodesk. Being within one part of the organization for ~3years helping 1,000+ internal business users with insights and analytic engineering, I went to another team within Autodesk to do the same things--but with a larger sub organization!

I remember my first day at Autodesk--it meant a lot to be a part of company with ethically positive impact in the world, at scale!

## 3. Code dependency issues

There was a major [Gems](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) [issue in ~2021](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2693) preventing me from locally updating this website. However, I found a way to update this website differently, without focusing on [Gems](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) installation and modifications.
