# What is an OKR?

OKR (Objectives and Key Results)[Not OKRA] is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and outcomes to drive engagement and focus on your goals.

**Objectives** are motivational, challenging, and qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve.

**Key Results **are a set of metrics that measure your progress towards the Objective.

OKR methodology was introduced to Intel by [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove) in his 1983 book “High Output Management”. Later on in 1999, Intel’s John Doerr recommends the methodology to Google’ CEOs Larry Page and Sergey Brin for their 40+team.

# OKR Example

#### OKR Formulation

The following is a general structure for forming and OKR

> _I will [Objective] as measured by [Key Result]._

and can be used in the following example

#### Example

Engineering Manager’s OKR:

**Objective:** Create a better Customer Experience

**Key Results:**

- Improve Net Promoter Score from X to Y.

- Mitigate Churn or Bounce Rate under Z%

- Improve Product/Business Awareness for Engineering team from 30% familiarity to 80% familiarity.

In some instances, a hierarchy of OKRs can be created too. The manager above can have OKRs tied to team performance and growth, outside of business objectives as well.

Employee’s OKR:

**Objective:** Improve Customer Journey with Product

**Key Results:**

- Create training/documentation on product usability

- Optimize UI and usability of product from X% engagement to X+ Y % engagement

> “If it does not have a number,

> it is not a Key Result.” -Marissa Mayer

# OKR Mistakes

OKRs sounds so enticing, and when starting with the methodology, many are tempted to “LIST ALL THE GOALS”. However, avoid these OKR mistakes to ensure you reach your goal(s):

- Forgetting about your OKRs

- Using OKR as a task list

- Setting too many OKRs (Use between 2–5 Objectives)

- Not aligning your OKRs

- Separate metrics from initiatives
