# Summary


The dbt (data build tool) Certification let's you show you're a reliable source for Analytics Engineering industry's development for (Operational) Analytics.

I would recommend [Paul Fry's article "Preparing for the dbt 'Analytics Engineering' Certification"](https://medium.com/geekculture/preparing-for-the-dbt-analytics-engineering-certification-5496c3ec6e15) as an introduction to what the dbt Certified Developer Certification is and resources.

This article will cover additional material & tips that would be helpful for folks, like myself
* About me: I have 2+years of dbt experience, 3+ years of Python development for Analytics and reporting. I am currently a Sr. Data Analyst @ Autodesk.

# The Exam

## The Scenario

### What would you do?

These questions are geared towards experienced model & development. Moreover, the question range from starting a dbt project to developing & testing (i.e Building) your first model. 

I would say this exam is more geared towards the following folks: 
* 3-6months of startup or full dbt project build
* 6+months in dbt experience

### You can be technically correct in one sense, but wrong in the question's scenario

Imagine you are configuring a YAML file called `src_sfdc.yml`. The question you get calls for identifying a test configuration. You have 4 multiple choice questions. Two of them say "model" in their explanation, and sound right. REMEMBER, this is about a **Source, not a model**.



## Mitigating Anxiety

* Learning about DOS testing strategy before you find out the hard way.


## Types of Questions

Someone after the exam told me they had 2 Snapshot questions. However, I have none of those, and 3+ Incremental questions
