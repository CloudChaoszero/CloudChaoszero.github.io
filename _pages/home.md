I enjoy solving problems and bringing value to both businesses and aspirant individuals through data & analytics-related tools or concepts. My career goal is to empower business users as a Data Scientist with baseline "jack of all trades and a master of none" framework championing best practices, ethics, and implementations.

You can reach out to me at [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulm8) for any questions or feedback.

I am happy to meet new people! Have a great day! :D
