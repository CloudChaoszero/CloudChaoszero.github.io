Welcome!
              
My name is Raul, and **I am a Data Analyst** residing in San Francisco, Ca. 

I enjoy solving problems and bringing value to both businesses and aspirant individuals through data & analytics-related tools or concepts. Going forward, I strive to be a " jack of all trades and a master of none" Data Scientist championing best practices, ethics, and implementations.


An example of this driven growth is working at Autodesk as a Data Analyst, Core Volunteer at PyBay 2019, Teaching Fellow at Delta Analytics,
and a Substitute Teaching Assistant for UC Berkeley Extension's Data Analytics bootcamp.

If you are seeking a Full Stack Data Analyst (Data Scientist) with experience implementing SQL, Python, BI Dashboards, Data Pipelines, and Statistical Methods,
and so much more, you can reach out to me [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulm8)

Have a great day!
