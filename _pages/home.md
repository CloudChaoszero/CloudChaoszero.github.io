    <div id="Introduction">
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
              
      <p>My name is Raul, and <strong>I am a Data Analyst </strong> residing in San Francisco, Ca. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy solving problems and bringing value to both businesses and aspirant individuals through data & analytics-related tools or concepts. Going forward, I strive to be a " jack of all trades and a master of none" Data Scientist championing best practices, ethics, and implementations.
      </p>

      <p>  
        An example of this driven growth is working at Autodesk as a Data Analyst, Core Volunteer at PyBay 2019, Teaching Fellow at Delta Analytics,
        and a Substitute Teaching Assistant for UC Berkeley Extension's Data Analytics bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
