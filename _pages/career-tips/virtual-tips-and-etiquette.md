## Motivation

During these unprecedented times, people around the world are going through major difficulties that either are pushing them into a lower in class, or is increasing the existing social status division. To help mitigate that in any way, I thought I'd offer my consultation on effectively transitiong into digital communication or learning


# 2. Joining a Call

## 2.1 Pre-join

Getting ready for your zoom call? The following are good steps I take before joining a call:

* Wifi Connection
* Earphones/Headphones
    * Backup earphones
* Position your camera properly
* Phone on "vibrate" mode, audio down
* If call is password protected, the password
* Join 2-3mins early, if an interview
    * First timer? 5+mins

## 2.2 The Join

* When entering the call, ensure you are on mute
    * Be mindful of background noise
* [Optional] Shy? Bad hair day? Disable Video
    * However, if the meeting requires you have your video on, then do as such
* Mind your environment
    * E.g. No random items or things to be seen are not in the background

## 3. What to Wear

### 3.1 General Advice

* If you're in an interview, I highly advise you wear clothes as if you're going into an in-person interview. 

* If you care about letting your appearance "pop out" a bit, using a light can help your image. I heard about [Ring lights](https://www.amazon.com/ring-light/s?k=ring+light); check it out!

* Pretty much, if you know you're attending a virtual event that requires a formality in-person, wear such clothes

### 3.2 The Specifics

* Tops
    * If you're in not in an interview, I advise on wearning a comfortable, but appropriate shirt.
        * If you're still working though, be sure to wear what is suitable for your team's comfortability
* Bottoms:
    * If you're cold, sweats will do. However, do know that when you stand up, you'll like you got out of bed
    * If you want to be comfortable, I recommend wearing shorts. Personally, I wear [Uniqlo Easy Shorts](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-dry-stretch-easy-shorts-423560COL09SMA004000.html)

# 4. Mind the....

## 4.1 Mind the Speaker
(i.e.  Respekt the person talking)

* Address Internet Disruptions
    * If addressed, first do it via Chat. After, try by turning on audio again

* Try to avoid talking at the same time as other participants
    * If an interruption occurs, take a few humbling seconds to let the other person speak

## 4.2 Mind the Attendees

* Limit distractions
    * Be aware you are on camera
    * Don't be me, easily getting distracted by Tweets (maybe youre case, TicTok?)

* Take your time sharing your screen. 
    * You don't want to share a screen of [your favorite music Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FXSN6Y2pgY)

# 5. Ending the Call

## 5.1 Cues
Ending a call can be tricky sometimes. In a social context, there are small "cues" that show when a conversation ending
> I'm more of the receiving end of those haha

However, virtual calls are quite different in identifying when a call should end. The following are some things I noticed that help me out:

* Near the end of the discussion, a person is quickly eyeing their time

* There is nothing to further discuss, aroudn 2/3's of the call's expected timeframe


## 5.2 Saying Goodbye

Here are the top ranked ways I look to say goodbye

1. Wave goodbye & smile  [Optional]
    * Just being friendly :)
    * Recently, I found out people do "peace sign" goodbyes
2. Saying goodbyes, meanwhile you're hovering the exit button
    * This helps mitigate awkward seconds of ending a call
