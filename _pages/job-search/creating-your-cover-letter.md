## Introduction

In this article, you will learn how to create a Cover Letter to effectively make you stand out to employers, compared to other candidates interviewing for job `XYZ`.

> "The cover letter is a formal business letter which is often the first contact with a prospective employer. It serves as an introduction of you and your background experience. Since it is usually the first impression you make on the employer, you want it to be your best."

### Agenda

1. Meeting the Minimal Requirements
2. Going above and beyond
3. Professional Personification
4. Conclusion

## What's the point of making a Cover Letter?

Cover Letters were an essential requirement in job applications in the past (Some may say even now). However, today's Cover Letters have become more of a secondary thought, therefore being **optional**. However, a Cover Letter may give you that subtle edge that can, just maybe, separate you from other applications.

>  To what Melody Godfred said [in this article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/cover-letter-examples-every-type-job-seeker), "in a cover letter you have an opportunity to craft a narrative that aligns you not only with the position you’re applying to but also the company you’re applying to.”


That being said, depending on the industry and role you are applying in, Cover Letters can be optional. However, one thing is clear about that, they can be one of the first baseline pieces to help you get that next opportunity.

## Why Listen to Me?

* You want to show a succinct and effective pitch for prospective jobs
* I have a seasoned experience in job searching (I.e. I had hella jobs)
    * In 2007, I went to a Taco Bell everyday until I got the opportunity to interview
    * 2016-2018 I worked contracted jobs in pursuit of achieving my goals in the Data-field
    * From 2017-2018, I worked in the gig economy as a "TaskRabbiter". There, I had to contstantly fine-tune my profile everyday for moving, officework, cleaning, and waiting in line tasks.
    * And more!
