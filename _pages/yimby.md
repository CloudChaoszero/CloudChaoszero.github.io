# Why I'm a YIMBY

I lived on Section 8 and Food Stamps (now known as CalFresh) growing up in a family of 9, in Modesto, CA. Being a 5th generation US citizen in Central Valley, I lived by couch surfing, motel, to regular suburban home. 

Being in a different income class today and seeing the desparities my hometown community getting displaced by Bay Area displaced folks, continued redlining in California, and more, I went into housing. 
* Note: This was actually after going into Bike advocacy, in late 2020.
* Note 2: I always watched political comedy shows, but was never an activist. Only until getting fed up by 2020 SF Orange Skies, BLM Protests, and 2020 Election outcome, I became an activist.

After careful decision making in what group to join for Housing-related matters in San Francisco, I joined YIMBY Action! 
* Note: This was a close call into following a political leader's group

So now, I advocate for diverse dense housing and tenant protections to ensure low-income people like my past self don't get displaced, rent is stable, and more.

Ultimately, I would like to reduce poverty, end homelessness, eliminate racial segregation, create jobs, mitigate displacement, and slow climate change.

# What's "YIMBY"?

YIMBY stands for "Yes in My Backyard".

> "YIMBYs see scarce housing as the result of shortsighted and discriminatory laws, which we know we can change when enough citizens speak up and vote. 

> We advocate for research-backed policies to increase the supply of housing, both market-rate housing and government subsidized housing. Our policies are informed by pragmatism; we focus on solutions that can lower the cost of housing without competing for scarce public dollars, and that get rid of red tape in favor of more effective, streamlined regulations."
