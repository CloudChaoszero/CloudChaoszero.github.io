# Why I'm a YIMBY

![YIMBY Action](https://yimbyaction.org/2021/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/08/image_from_ios-6-scaled-e1628888786710-1536x1155.jpg)

Ultimately, I would like to reduce poverty, end homelessness, eliminate racial segregation, create jobs, mitigate displacement, and slow climate change.


# What's "YIMBY"?

YIMBY stands for "Yes in My Backyard".

> "YIMBYs see scarce housing as the result of shortsighted and discriminatory laws, which we know we can change when enough citizens speak up and vote. 

> We advocate for research-backed policies to increase the supply of housing, both market-rate housing and government subsidized housing. Our policies are informed by pragmatism; we focus on solutions that can lower the cost of housing without competing for scarce public dollars, and that get rid of red tape in favor of more effective, streamlined regulations."
