# Puns

## General

* You: pop tart
    * Me, an intellectual: pastryarchy
* People don’t take my fear of clowns seriously.
    * But it’s no laughing matter.

* I fear for my calendar.
    * Its days are numbered

* Seems like inflation might have peaked, but that’s just my 3 cents.

## Math

* Why is statistics never anyone’s favorite subject? It’s just average.

* Q: How do you stay warm in an empty room?
    * A: Go stand in the corner—it’s always 90 degrees.

* I saw my math teacher with a piece of graph paper yesterday. I think he must be plotting something.

* I had an argument with a 90° angle. It turns out it was right.

* Have you heard the one about the statistician? Probably.
