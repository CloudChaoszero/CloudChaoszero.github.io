        "title": "In the Eyes of the Aspired, from the View Quite Higher",
        "excerpt":"   I wrote this when I was a Teller at Wells Fargo in 2016. I thought I’d share it to inspire other aspired individuals to reach not their dreams, but their goals.      “Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.” — Tony Robbins    My activities in my youth were quite slothful. I would enjoy my time playing action shooter video games online. I recall staying up in the evenings till eleven at night in the same scenario of completing unfulfilling game challenges. Entering junior college in 2010 after high school, I made the decision to quit my lifelong passion of video games to culminate my educational career.      Furthermore, I pondered on the perception of my grandmother consistently seeing me enjoy my time playing video games as she did house chores all while working horrible late evening shifts. Her perception of me hated myself because I didn’t want to be another disappointment in my family.   I needed to change, fast.   I can grandma’s hard work ethic woven into the characteristics I provide for my activities. I have worked consecutively since my sophomore year of high school, in 2007. However, I crippled my grade point average during my attendance at University of California, Davis (UCD). I worked as a Student Housing Logistics member, where I moved incoming freshmen furniture, a Student Housing Janitor in my summers, and then became a cafe manager for one year. These indications displayed my distaste for a languid lifestyle, but should have focused that same attention to my studies.   Furthermore, to properly finance myself during my attendance in college, I needed to maintain my job status to support myself. These actions are not excuses for my average performance in my Mathematics upper division courses, but indicate the level of my productive daily activities.   Standing in the discussion of academia performance, I switched the emphasis of my major from General Mathematics to Applied Mathematics, the second to last year of my stay at UCD. General Mathematics offered simplistic theories and hypotheses with a tremendous amount of abstractive work that had no applications to world scenarios; the degree of application being higher in applied mathematics compared to the general case.   My actual shift from general Mathematics would have been Statistics, but that would have required me to not progress from my undergraduate career until spring of 2017. By graduating in March 2016 at UCD, I realized I was able to perform Statistics and other relatable Data Science applications independent from my attendance at my university.   This past fall, I moved from Davis, Ca to San Francisco to become a data scientist consultant while simultaneously delve into the data science community. However, these initial months of my data scientist goals have been set back. I could not find relatable careers outside my current in-congruent job to hone my technical skills. I am currently a teller at Wells Fargo. The rich time I utilized to financially support myself with my job pauses my technical tools and knowledge for implementing big data analysis.   My vigorous passion to become a data scientist all while being unique stems from my cautious nature to avoid generational repetition of being low income status.   My mother and several older family members never required me to go to high school. I could easily not go to high school, and not graduate from it. I could have continued playing video games and binge watching television shows in my latter part of my teen years.   Furthermore, I didn’t have to waste two to three hours in the hot weather or cold rain for public transportation to get to school. I didn’t have to work a minimum wage job to support myself to get a computer, feed myself properly, or generate funds to help my grandma.   However, my path to not be another low income statistic has lead me to be the first in my family to getting a college degree, and move forward to a progressing technical world of innovation, San Francisco…and become a Data Scientist.

        "title": "Farewell, MobileIron",
        "excerpt":"Today was my last day contracting for MobileIron. I was onboarded in August 2017 as the Business Application team’s Data Analyst for an ongoing project.   What has felt like such a small time-frame, almost one year, I am humbled to have had this great opportunity to work with a wonderful and diverse team. In my time there, I had the opportunity to become a certified Salesforce Administrator, participate in both Sprint and Scrum methodology, lead some post analysis and reporting initiatives in Domo, and so much more!   Additionally, I had the opportunity to go to Dreamforce 2017 for the first time; oh my, my goal to going to Dreamforce happened!      However, the best experiences at MobileIron were my team — especially learning from my manager. Both my team and my manager’s humbling and great thinking were a great opportunity for technical and business experience exposure, surrounding data. This diverse exposure to certain ideas, communication, and so much more has enabled me to grow my business skills simultaneous to my analytic related skills.   However, since the release of the project earlier this year, I knew I was excited for my next steps/challenges, while maintaining my evening role as a Teaching Assistant at a Data Bootcamp.   To you, the reader, here are a few learning lessons I learned in my time at MobileIron:   Sales Cycle is so much more than purchasing an item and Sales team ownership      With this opportunity, I not only learned about the general cycle of a B2B transaction, but I understood the technical flow of said transaction from Prospect to a Closed Won Opportunity. Additionally, I met a great and diverse group of Sales users in the Sales department. Additionally, I got to meet other individuals that partake in closing a transaction. I loved everyone’s high energy and great personalities. Adopting some of their own communication skills has allowed me to become an effective communicator with some of those users.   “Slow is Smooth, and Smooth is Fast”   I had the great opportunity to not only work with the Business Application team at MobileIron, but I had the pleasure of working with a great consulting Project Manager. His wonderful jokes, laughs, and general personality combined with his effective work ethic has showed me what it takes to balance work and family life.      One quote that stuck out to me when talking with him was “Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast”.   This changed the way I thought about assigned data analysis tasks. Getting the job done is great, but doing it with being mindful is better.   You are always learning   I had the opportunity to be under a great manager. She taught me a lot about how to accelerate my personal growth in data and business. She was even happy to teach me her strategies to emulate herself on being effective with business operations and communication. I am truly thankful for the opportunity for me to be the team’s Data Analyst…and her being a great mentor.   Now   I am excited to start my next opportunity next week. I will have the opportunity to utilize some of my higher level technical skills. In particular, I will be using SQL, Python, and Angular.js within my next role’s responsibilities. Lastly, I get to work onsite with another great team and company!   So, farewell MobileIron. I am “owning” my career…..   with an “iron” fist. Get it (Mobile “Iron”)? haha   Anyways,   “Own it”      Cheers,   Raul Maldonado  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Quickly Getting Started with Google Maps API w/Python (July 2018 Platform)",
        "excerpt":"You probably want to harness the power of Google Maps API for application development. Moreover, your are coding in Python.   This article provides instruction on how to utilize Google Map’s API from the new Maps Platform, and a brief mention about the legacy process ( Post July 2018 and Pre-July 2018, respectively).   I will start with the newer process, and then go into the Legacy process for existing developer accounts from developers.google.com.   If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn.   Prerequisites:           Python 3.6 (can have older versions…but get with the times)            requests library (built-in with Python)            Google Account       New Process (Post July 2018)      Get Started   Please go to https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/ , below.                           [**Geo-location APIs         Google Maps Platform         Google Cloud**](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)                   Choose Google Maps Platform to create immersive location experiences and make better business decisions with accurate real-time data &amp; dynamic imagery.    After that, click on “Get Started”.   You will see a list of options to enable API groups. For limiting the number of types of APIs you manage for your account, you can select the desired API you want to use.   If you select one type of API group, then those will only be enabled. All other APIs would have to be enabled thereafter.   For playing around, let’s enable them all, seen below      Thereafter, you can select an existing project (session, if you will) or create a new project. (e.g. Title: myApplicationWillBeFire)   Now, you must enter in some billing information. Though we are entering are billing information, and assumingly testing out this API, we should not be charged for using the API. Per pricing documentation here, “get $200 in free usage for Maps, Routes, and Places every month”.   Cool. :)      **Note: **Just be careful if you have your app running in production with a lot of requests made to Google Maps API. Else, you may get charged in that month of all $200 credits being used    Assuming you enabled all three API groups, we can now get our API credential key. You can find this credential key in any of the API listings, or in your home page. Just look for the credentials tab.   Now that we have the credentials, we request information from the enabled MapsAPI “Geocoding API” through our python file     You should see a the JSON object from response_json .   Note: THIS DOCUMENTATION LINK IS YOUR FRIEND   ……..or stackoverflow….ha   Old Processs (Pre-July 2018)                  [Per documentation](&lt;https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/?__utma=102347093.1225766217.1531971273.1531974912.1531974912.1&amp;__utmb=102347093.0.10.1531974912&amp;__utmc=102347093&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=102347093.1531974912.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)       utmccn=(direct)       utmcmd=(none)&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=194186285&amp;_ga=2.26811837.1017490544.1531971273-1225766217.1531971273&gt;), existing developers using Google’s Maps API know              With the launch of Google Maps Platform, we’ve introduced changes to our products, pricing, and support to provide you with greater flexibility, transparency, and control. This guide explains how these changes may impact you and what steps you need to take. You can also read our blog for additional context.       As of June 11, 2018, you must enable billing with a credit card and have a valid API key for all of your projects. This will give you the ability to scale easily with less downtime and fewer performance issues. In addition, we’ve simplified our 18 individual APIs into three products: Maps, Routes, and Places.       In June 2016 we announced that we would stop supporting keyless usage, meaning any request that doesn’t include an API key or Client ID. This went into effect on June 11 2018, and keyless access is no longer supported. Keyless calls to the Maps JavaScript API and Street View API will return low-resolution maps watermarked with “for development purposes only.” Keyless calls to any of the following APIs will return an error: Maps Static API (including Static Street View), Directions API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Geolocation API, Places API, Roads API, and Time Zone API.    The old process was to simply to go to developers.google.com with your google account and create your developer account. Therafter, you could generate a key credential key in your project, without having to enable any APIs. It was just starting that project, and then creating the key for one API usage.   Ending Comments (Will be updated):   Why have a pricing model for API platform?   My opinion is that applications from indie developers have have been popular, and using Google’s API service at an extraneous/well performed rate shows opportunity to capatilize on provided service. This is normal in industry.   What’s great is that they at least do $200 each month, pay as you use. Anything more, then you pay.   Was it easier back then?   A bit, but times change. haha   How is the billing calculated?      Usage is tracked for each Product SKU.       A SKU is the combination of the Product API + the service or function called (for example, Places API — Place Details).       A product may have multiple SKUs billed at different rates (for example, Places API — Place Details; Places API — Autocomplete — Per Character).       SKU pricing is tiered, based on volume of use, with three tiers: 0–100,000; 100,001–500,000; 500,001+.       Cost is calculated by SKU Usage x Price per each use.       For each billing account, for qualifying Google Maps Platform SKUs, a $200 USD Google Maps Platform credit is available each month, and automatically applied to the qualifying SKUs.

        "excerpt":"It’s been 1 week since I started the next part of my journey — a situation in which a lot of my coworkers appeared startled after responding “Nothing yet. I am going to start looking for my next opportunity soon” after the question “Where are you going to go next?”…   I made the decision to not extend my Business Data Analyst contract at a Top 10 Technology company.      From the food, commuting, work environment, and various fruitful amenities provided from the role to working with a wonderful group of Business Intelligence, Insights, and Engineering individuals in an agile and great environment, I was still not satisfied. I was not content with myself.   I still yearned to deliver scalable data solutions with recognition as a team member of the encompassing organization, as opposed to an external contributor. Moreover, I wanted to acquire and grow new data-related skills and techniques while maintaining my existing proficient data analytics experiences.      “You are your own startup”    If you know me, my driven goals for career growth aspirations and providing qualitative analyses, automation, visualization, and knowledge to organizations stem from my core goal after graduating college— being part of a team making effective contributions, and feel a part of that organization. I had no opportunities handed to me, so I set to obtain those experiences through contracting. Thereafter, I would transition my skills to provide deployed solutions thereby turning complex data into meaningful insights and comprehensive business recommendations.      “Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” — Thomas Edison    That’s a story I talked about in a past article, but I am happy to the recent experiences I acquired from this role. As a sample of my recent accomplishments, I enabled a large organization of Sales users to understand compensation and SMB customer performances assigned to them for increased productivity, resolved and improved performances of workflows for deliverable data from disparate systems to other teams, built automation tools, lead in contributions for engineering requests, and even provided knowledge transfer sessions to enable other BI or developer contractors to effectively enable them to drive impact to the organization themselves.   When the time came to turn in my badge, I felt satisfied. I accomplished so much with my past implementations, and I was excited for the next opportunity for providing scalable data analytic and technical solutions for the next team I will collaborate with. Additionally, what was definitely a pleasing thought in turning my badge was amusingly recalling a quote I provided in a “Thank You” follow up email (from a brutal onsite technical interview from this mentioned contracting role) …      “It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.” -Sir Edmund Hillary     In the meantime, I am still a Teaching Assistant for an evening Data Analytics bootcamp enabling 30+student cohorts to understand and develop Big Data related projects and volunteering for a Data-for-Good nonprofit.   Moreover, I am showcasing deliverable data insights and tools from my experiences through several projects for my Q1 2019 pipeline. Stay tuned for that. :)   Here is a selection of personal projects and presentations I have created in the past:           Website (hosted via Git Pages)            Strava Data Visualization            Google Ads: Search Certification            SalesForce Admin Certification            Lightning Talk/Seminar at a Python Meetup            Data Analytics Bootcamp: Example Lecture            Visual Portfolio/Resume (powered by Tableau)            Youtube Data Analysis Project            Compilation of other data projects via Github       You can reach me via LinkedIn for any inquires or questions on projects, experiences, or how I can contribute to your data-related learnings.

Objectives are motivational, challenging, and qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve.   **Key Results **are a set of metrics that measure your progress towards the Objective.      OKR methodology was introduced to Intel by Andy Grove in his 1983 book “High Output Management”. Later on in 1999, Intel’s John Doerr recommends the methodology to Google’ CEOs Larry Page and Sergey Brin for their 40+team.   OKR Example   OKR Formulation   The following is a general structure for forming and OKR      I will [Objective] as measured by [Key Result].    and can be used in the following example   Example   Engineering Manager’s OKR:   Objective: Create a better Customer Experience   Key Results:           Improve Net Promoter Score from X to Y.
